Even-Odd Number Example

Check whether the given number is even or odd. Then, print results to the screen.

Main Algorithm

1. Ask for & get a number from user
2. Check the remainder of the given number when division by two
3. if the reminder is equal to zero then
3T	report the number is even
   else
3F	report the number is odd

Data Requirements
number - integer variable
remainder - integer variable
Expand 1.

1.1 Prompt user to enter any number
1.2 Read number from keyboard

Data Requirements
number - integer variable
