Even-Odd Number Example

Check whether the given number is even or odd. Then, print results to the screen.

Main Algorithm

1. Ask for & get a number from user
2. Check the remainder of the given number from division by two
3. if its reminder is equals to zero then
3T	report the number is even
   else
3F	report the number is odd

Data Requirements
number - integer variable

Expand 1.

1.1 Prompt user to enter any number
1.2 Read number from keyboard

Data Requirements
number - integer variable

Implementation

import java.util.Scanner;

  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    int number;
    System.out.println("Enter an Integer number:");

    //Get the number from user
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    number = scan.nextInt();

    /* Check the remainder of the number from division by two
     *If its remainder is zero then report that number is even
     * else number is odd*/
    if ( number % 2 == 0 )
        System.out.println("The number is even");
     else
        System.out.println("The number is odd");
  }
