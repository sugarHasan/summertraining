Zoom meeting planning

Zoom meeting, started the work on react with berke

22.07.2020
Created mockups

Worked on react, I find a template and tried implement it with our c++ code

Me and berke give example to our c++ code while doing zoom meeting and still trying to implement template

20:00 - 4:00
Able to run project in localhost. 
Add and remove pseudocode feature is added.
Adding main and sub steps are added.
Search bar is added.
Still a lot of bugs but working on it.

Do lots of tracing in code to understand functions. Although project is black box, most functions that we need are not implemented. So, our progress will be slowed little bit.
Resizeable text are is added but it has bugs.
Step numbers, parent steps and codes are printed in below. Parent steps and codes are printed in real time without delay. However, Step numbers is really buggy. I am working on it.
Read me file added to installion guide.

Main Step Count function is added but it is not refreshing when we delete node. Reason why it is not refreshing is not due to us. I implemented this method with search library which is also not refreshing when you delete node. It refreshs when you change search text. 
Fix a bug which is when substep is created, its text same as parent.

I partly fixed id printing problem. I fix same part of it but still it is not working correctly. Also, it refresh data with delay. It shows previous step results. I spend a lot of time but still we dont have model and controller classes so it is really hard to implement without them.
Also, I tried to implement special if else steps but drag and drop has some problem in template so I have started to watching react-dnd tutorials to fix problems

Watch some youtube tutorials(bald guy which glasses). I dont know how much time I spend on it. I have tried to understand drag and drop (dnd). Didnt do implementation just learning.

I fixed the problem of main step count. It is counting correctly right now. Also, sir If you are reading this, you seams like you think it is easy thing, but I swear it is not easy thing. Let me explain why; Our data is stored in tree data but reading I use flat data which is array version of tree data. You cannot traverse tree data. Only way is to read tree. Flat data stores nodes in top down order so its mixed with subs and main steps. So if you want to create main step, you need to know how many main steps already there and add plus one to that number you will get main step id. But for long time I couldnt fix it. It always shows begining main step number even if you add more main step it remains same. So I add modifications that when you click main button it refreshes finally. It did take time. I am serious. But as I mention previous logs, it is still refresh delayed but finally I found the reason why. It checks the counts then add steps. Weirdly, I did checking after the adding new node, It always checks counts then add steps. But I believe I can fix it tomorrow.
Also I add a lots of comment to help my friends to understand code. Also, you can check it, so you will see it is not all template or just copy and pasted code. I know every parts of it because I spend lots of time on it although you sir say it seems too easy to implement. Sometimes I didnt add anything the code doesnt mean I didnt do anything. Most of times I have speand time on searching and trying to understand the problem.

I added tracing so you. You can go next or prev steps and current step is highlighted as red.
