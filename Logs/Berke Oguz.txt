13.00 - 14.30
I search for some pseudo code examples and write one which can be uselful for the project

15.00 - 17.00
We spend some time to talk about how to design the web page, then decided on doing some mockup pages and talked on them because it is more concrete and easy to understand on some ideas on a template web page.

17.00 - 19.00
I search for a free mockup tool and create a sample mockup page related to the project so that we can easily communucate what's in our mind

For the future plan, we will decide whether the statements(condition statements, loops etc...) that we drag and drop will be already prepared at the rightmost of the page or user will write them in a blank statement card.

10.00 - 14.00
We talked about some different ideas about the project on whatsapp
I do some changes on my mockup pages that I don't like and the some feedbacks of my friends

I decided to add a next step button to the project which trace the pseudo code one by one. The color of the related step will change, however, in the condition statements it might be too hard to decide which way the statement goes on(Will the if part or else part works at that step).
Therefore, we will argue it again and decide what to do about it.
Most logical idea that we argue from now on is uncompleted statements with some blanks that user will fill and drop the algorithm area.

Working on react.I examine the codes that we found and try to understand how we will do the implementation. It still seems complicated to design webpage according to mockups that we create.

Off day

14.00 - 16.00
I saw the feedback mail. I revise the pseudo code algorithm examples again and think about a simple example to write.
17.00 - 18.00
I write a new pseudo algorithm example.

I started to coding of UI part. I add the buttons learn how to do event handling and do a test of event handling of buttons. I can manage to work buttons,so,I will fill the button click functions with their proper working codes after implementing the main algorithm part. However, I can't put the buttons exactly where I want.Therefore, I am working on css part of the project to put the buttons to relevant places.

We found a really good website about the project. There is a nice coding about indentation and algorithm part. At first, we are trying to understand the code while it seems a bit complicated. Since we are a bit unfamiliar with react, js and css the progress goes somehow slower than I thought. However, you can be sure that we are working on it. Hopefully, we will implement something similar to our website soon.

10.30 - 13.00 & 14.00 - 17.00
I looked at the code and tried to understand it. I started to implementation of the UI part. We are working simultanously with Kaan while implementing the view of the webpage while Hasan is working on the background(Model) of the project.
We can manage to implement the tree structured algorithm part to the project and add main part and substep parts to the algorithm lines.

15.00 - 19.00 & 22.00 - 23.30
I worked on printing part of the project. We can add main steps to the algorithm, however, the numbering of the printing part is not working correctly. I found the error. In the main step part, node.id in that function seems undefined. However, I could not manage to fix it even if I tried too much.

16.30 - 20.00 & 22.00 - 23.30
After the zoom meeting, I started to research about the controller part of the project. I researched and learn how to connect model and view classes with controller. I tried to move some code segments that we implemented in the app.js(view) to this controller file, however, I will not do it for now.The reason is that every code segment is related to each other and when I tried to move them to another file, it crushed everytime somehow. I hope I will be able to implement  them after connecting the new model classes with the view.

12.00 - 17.30
Process was a little bit slow for today. We all are trying to fixin some errors of our parts. If we can manage to correct them, I hope I can connect the UI and background of the project.
I am still waiting for the completing the other parts of to project and learning about using functions clearly in order to make the code more clear and understandable.
